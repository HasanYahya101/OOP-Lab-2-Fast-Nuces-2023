# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++

_>>This repository contains solutions to five programming problems related to pointer Arrays in C++. The problems are part of a lab for an Object Oriented Programming course offered at Fast Nuces Lahore._

## Problem 1: [Copy & Reduce Array](https://github.com/HasanYahya101/OOP-Lab-2-Fast-Nuces-2023/blob/main/l227971_q1_Lab2.cpp)

**Implement two functions to perform array operations:**

- _**copyArray(int* arr, int *&arr1, int size)** to copy arr into arr1_
- _**reduceArray(int *arr, int *&arr1, int size)** to reduce the size of array by removing elements from start and copying remaining elements into arr1._

## Problem 2: [Reverse Array](https://github.com/HasanYahya101/OOP-Lab-2-Fast-Nuces-2023/blob/main/l227971_q2_lab2.cpp)

_**C++**_ program that takes integer input from the user until the user enters -1 and displays the data in reverse order. 
The program should save the input in a dynamically allocated array that doubles in size each time it gets filled. 
After receiving -1, the program should print the integers in reverse order.

## Problem 3: [String Concatenation](https://github.com/HasanYahya101/OOP-Lab-2-Fast-Nuces-2023/blob/main/l227971_q3_lab2.cpp)

A _**C++**_ function **_StringConcat_** to concatenate two strings and store their result in the first string. 
Concatenated string should fit perfectly in the first string.

## Problem 4: [Matrix Rows & Columns](https://github.com/HasanYahya101/OOP-Lab-2-Fast-Nuces-2023/blob/main/l227971_q4_lab2.cpp)

A program that inputs the number of rows and columns from the user, inputs the elements to store in the matrix, calculates the sum of each row and column, and displays the results on the Console.
Also, check if the matrix is a Square.

## Problem 5: [Intersection of 3 Sets](https://github.com/HasanYahya101/OOP-Lab-2-Fast-Nuces-2023/blob/main/l227971_q5_lab2.cpp)

Given three sets of equal length, compute their intersections and store the results in a 2D array. 
Ensure that no row has any empty cells.
